    <p>Sophia pressed the button in front of her, slamming her fist against it. The door rumbled and appeared to do
        nothing.</p>

    <p>“Oh man, that’s not very interesting at all.” Sofia complained.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, the the door hissed and a jet of ice cold steam billowed out. The door began moving out the wall as
        if it were pushed from the inside. Sofia and the other two stepped back, watching their feet. The wall
        finally stopped
        moving and revealed itself to be a large chest of some sort. </p>

    <p>“Oh man, could it be treasure?” Sofia studied the chest intently.</p>

    <p>Nikola poked his head through the doorway where the chest had just exited. “Well, there’s nothing in there but
        darkness.” He turned to the chest which stood several feet taller than him and began studying it himself. He
        noticed some carvings on the side. “Hey, this looks like a manifest of some sort. Or a contents label. Look,
        there Ag, Na, Li, Mg... all raw materials we could use to fabricate the parts we need to fix the ship!”</p>

    <p>“There’s a keypad on it though... It’s locked.” Sofia said with a frustrated sigh.</p>

    <p>“No problem, we can solve it. Let’s take a look!”</p>
</div>

<p>On the chest keypad is a grid of numbered dots. The grid is comprised of a square shaped array of dots and contains
    lines
    that connect some pairs of adjacent dots. The answer to the code is the number of squares that are formed by these
    lines. For example, in the figure shown below, there are 3 squares: 2 small squares and 1 medium square.</p>

<p>
    The dots are marked by the numbers 1 through 16. The endpoints of the lines are represented by lists of two numbers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input:</strong>
    A list of lists. Each list consists of the two numbers which represent the endpoints of the line.
<p>

<p>
    <strong>Output:</strong>
    The quantity of squares formed. An integer.
